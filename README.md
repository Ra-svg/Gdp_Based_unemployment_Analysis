# Gdp_Based_unemployment_Analysis

The project, titled "GDP and Unemployment Analysis," examines the relationship between a country's GDP and its unemployment rates using datasets from the World Bank and Kaggle. By exploring data up to the year 2021, this analysis seeks to understand how GDP influences or correlates with the economic conditions reflected in unemployment percentages, utilizing various data processing techniques for cleaning and preparing the data. Additionally, the project employs visualizations, including choropleth maps, to present findings in an intuitive and engaging manner. This research aims to provide insights into the dynamics between economic growth and employment levels across different countries.


# Future Scope 


The future scope for the "GDP and Unemployment Analysis" project includes extending the analysis with updated data for a more timely perspective. Integrating additional economic indicators, such as inflation and education levels, could offer deeper insights into unemployment trends. 

Applying advanced predictive models might enable forecasting of unemployment rates, aiding in policy formulation. A comparative study across different geographical regions could highlight effective economic strategies. Implementing an interactive dashboard would allow for dynamic exploration of economic data. This approach would not only enrich the analysis but also make it more accessible and actionable for stakeholders.
